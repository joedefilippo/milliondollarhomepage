Data Analysis of milliondollarhomepage.com/

In 2005, Alex Tew, a student from England, developed a web page to help pay for his university education
The Million Dollar Homepage (milliondollarhomepage.com) was born.  The webpage consisted of 1 million pixels
and Alex sold each pixel to advertisers for $1.  The result was one of the most clever websites ever devised.
15 years later, the web page still generates about 70,000 visitors per month.

This purpose of this project is to analyze the million dollar homepage to gain any interesting insights.
