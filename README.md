Data Analysis of milliondollarhomepage.com/

In 2005, Alex Tew, a student from England, developed a web page to help pay for his university education
The Million Dollar Homepage (milliondollarhomepage.com) was born.  The webpage consisted of 1 million pixels
and Alex sold each pixel to advertisers for $1.  The result was one of the most clever websites ever devised.
15 years later, the web page still generates about 70,000 visitors per month and Alex went on to be co-founder
and co-CEO of Calm.com.

This purpose of this project is to analyze the million dollar homepage to gain any interesting insights.
